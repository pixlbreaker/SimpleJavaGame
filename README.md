# SimpleJavaGame
Need a really unpolished and demanding game, Java has you covered!

It works with a Simple Java GUI, cube, and a circle. The cube is moved with the keys WASD. 
The circle uses a very simplistic AI to try and get away from the cube.

There is threading in this application, yet it is not efficient in any way and requires alot of resources to run.
